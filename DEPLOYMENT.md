# Deployment Cache Fix Guide

## Problem
The 404 errors were caused by browser and CDN caching issues where:
1. Old HTML files referenced assets with outdated hashes
2. Service worker was caching stale responses
3. Google Fonts were still being loaded externally

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Service Worker Removed
- Removed problematic `sw.js` that was causing cache conflicts
- Simplified caching strategy handled by Netlify/CDN

### 2. ✅ Local Fonts Only
- Replaced Google Fonts imports with local font files
- All fonts now served from `/public/fonts/` directory
- Fixed font CSS files to use local paths (`./filename.ttf`)
- No external font requests

### 3. ✅ Cache Headers Added
- Added cache-busting headers in `netlify.toml`
- HTML files: no-cache policy
- Assets: long-term caching with immutable flag

### 4. ✅ Cache-Control Meta Tags
- Added cache-busting meta tags to `index.html`
- Prevents browser from serving stale HTML

### 5. ✅ Font Path Resolution
- Fixed font CSS files to reference local files
- Fonts are now properly bundled as Vite assets
- Eliminates MIME type errors and 404s

## Current Asset Hashes
- CSS: `index-CVAZm2wO.css`
- JS: `index-BhQhQ9XY.js`
- HomePage chunk: `HomePage-Bu8NNKf9.js`

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build**: `npm run build`
2. **Verify Assets**: Check `dist/` for correct file hashes
3. **Deploy**: Push to main branch (auto-deploys to Netlify)
4. **Clear CDN Cache**: If issues persist, clear Netlify cache
5. **Test**: Open in private/incognito window

## Force Cache Clear (Emergency)

If users still see 404s:

1. **Browser**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Netlify**: Deploy with cache clear: 
   ```bash
   # In Netlify dashboard, trigger new deploy with "Clear cache"
   ```
3. **DNS**: If using Cloudflare, purge cache there too

## Prevention

- The current setup should prevent future cache issues
- New builds will always have new asset hashes
- HTML is never cached thanks to headers
